<h1> BeGreen Inventory :seedling: </h1>
> Status: Developing

## It's a simple CRUD Project planned by me to make my Job at BeGreen easier.

## Overview :memo:
:pencil:

### In my job we have some issues that I wanted to solve, one of them is the difficult of make an inventory about all the products that are on the farm. In resume, we have to make a note of all of ours activitys and them, when we need to make the inventory of products we dont have a place where we can confer that notes, therefore we need to make all of our notes one more time, which make us lose our time and be less productive.
## In this project I need some fields, which is:

+ id
+ benches
+ variety
+ allotment
+ amount

## In addition to CRUD, I implement other features such as:
+ See the more recently variety planted on a bench
+ Search varietys by their name, date, allotment and/or benches
